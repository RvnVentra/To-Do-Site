# To-Do-Site

A typical To-Do site made using the Create React App & the React library, allowing users to create a list of items and deleting said items.

This project was made to *hopefully* demonstrate basic understandings of React, how to create websites using pure functional components, managing states with lifecycle hooks, and an attempt at creating a light/dark mode button to change CSS for the entire project with a single click.
